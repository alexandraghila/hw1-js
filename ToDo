# JavaScript Practice Tasks

## Task 1

Declare a variable 'person' which will be an empty string. Then create variables for age and name (considering this is the family name). After that, create another constant that will represent the person ID (CID). Use the proper operator to create a text explaining the person's name, age and ID. Log it in the console.

## Task 2

Declare a variable named 'toBeMultiplied' which represents the number for the multiplication table. Use the proper operator and log the multiplication table for the variable you haves created.

## Task 3

Create a story with the following messages:

- Matthew's hobby list wil expand after years.
- He learned to play volley.
- Then he goes to football, loves that sport.
- In the end, he switched to tennis and started playing it at a professional level.

Matthew's name needs (if you don't have any clue how to do it, just assign a name and it's fine) to be a variable accepted from user input. Define all sports as variables. In the end, compose a new text that contains this story and the hobby list.

## Task 4

Use prompt to have the user input. Compare that input with the age limit using logical operators so the response will be the value of variable. Log that variable in the console.

## Task 5

Concatenate first and last name coming from user input.
